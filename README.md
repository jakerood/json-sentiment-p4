# Project 4: Requests, JSON, and NLP
## Name: Jake Rood

This repository contains my work for Project 4 in the course "Web Mining and Applied Natural Language Processing." The exercises within the "requests-json-nlp" notebook illustrate how to access web-hosted APIs, get back a JSON response from an external site, and extract the information needed from the JSON. Specifically, an API is used to access song lyrics and the song lyrics are saved as JSON files. The contents of the files are read in and spaCyTextBlob is then used to perform sentiment analysis on the lyrics.
