{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Made in America par Toby Keith\r\n\nMy old man's that old man, spent his life livin' off the land\nDirty hands and a clean soul\nIt breaks his heart seein' foreign cars filled with fuel that isn't ours\nAnd wearin' cotton we didn't grow\n\n\nHe's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm\nSemper Fi tattooed on his left arm\nSpend a little more at the store for a tag\nIn the back that says U-S-A\nHe won't buy nothin' that he can't fix\nWith WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench\n\nHe ain't prejudiced, he's just\nMade in America\n\nHe loves his wife, but she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July\nBut says, \"Every day's Independence Day\"\nShe's golden rule, teaches school, some folks say it isn't cool\nBut she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway\n\n\nHe's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm\nSemper Fi tattooed on his left arm\nSpend a little more in the store for a tag\nIn the back that says U-S-A\nHe won't buy nothin' that he can't fix\nWith WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench\n\nHe ain't prejudiced, he's just\nMade in America\n\n\nBorn in the heartland, raised up a family\nOf King James and Uncle Sam\n\n\nHe's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm\nSemper Fi tattooed on his left arm\nSpend a little more in the store for a tag\nIn the back that says U-S-A\nWon't buy nothin' that he can't fix\nWith WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench\nHe ain't prejudiced, he's just\nMade in America\n\n\nMade in America\nMade in America\nYeah, my old man's that old man\nMade in America"}
