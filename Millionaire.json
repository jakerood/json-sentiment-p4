{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Millionaire par Chris Stapleton\r\nThey say \"Love is more precious than gold\"\nCan't be bought and it can't be sold\nI got love enough to spare\nThat makes me a millionaire\n\nI got a woman with eyes that shine\nDown deep as a diamond mine\nShe's my treasure so very rare\nShe made me a millionaire\n\nWhen we ride around, ride around this old town\nIn the beat-up car, with my windows down\nPeople look at her and they look at me\nSaying \"That boy's sure living in luxury\"\nSweet luxury\n\n\nCause love is more precious than gold\nIt can't be bought never could be sold\nI got love enough to share\nThat makes me a millionaire\n\nWhen the kisses fall from everywhere\nLife reaches on, millionaire\nWhen the pocket's are empty and the cover is bare\nI still feel like a millionaire\n\nCause love is more precious than gold\nIt can't be bought and it can't be sold\nI got love enough to spare\nThat makes me a millionaire"}
