{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Mama Tried par Merle Haggard\r\nThe first thing I remember knowing,\nWas a lonesome whistle blowing,\nAnd a young un's dream of growing up to ride;\nOn a freight train leaving town,\nNot knowing where I'm bound,\nNo-one could change my mind but Mama tried.\nOne and only rebel child,\nFrom a family, meek and mild:\nMy Mama seemed to know what lay in store.\nDespite all my Sunday learning,\nTowards the bad, I kept on turning.\n'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore.\nAnd I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole.\nNo-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.\n\nMama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.\nThat leaves only me to blame 'cos Mama tried.\nInstrumental break.\nDear old Daddy, rest his soul,\nLeft my Mom a heavy load;\nShe tried so very hard to fill his shoes.\nWorking hours without rest,\nWanted me to have the best.\nShe tried to raise me right but I refused.\nAnd I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole.\nNo-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.\nMama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.\nThat leaves only me to blame 'cos Mama tried."}
