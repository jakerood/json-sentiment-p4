{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Summertime par Kenny Chesney\r\nSummertime is finally here \n\nThat old ballpark, man, is back in gear \n\nOut on 49 \n\nMan I can see the lights \n\n\n\nSchool's out and the nights roll in \n\nMan, just like a long lost friend \n\nYou ain't seen in a while \n\nAnd can't help but smile \n\n\n\nAnd it's two bare feet on the dashboard \n\nYoung love and an old Ford \n\nCheap shades and a tattoo \n\nAnd a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard \n\n\n\nPerfect song on the radio \n\n\nSing along 'cause it's one we know \n\nIt's a smile, it's a kiss \n\nIt's a sip of wine, it's summertime \n\nSweet summertime \n\n\n\nTemperature says 93 \n\nDown at the Deposit and Guarantee \n\nBut that swimmin' hole \n\nIt's nice and cold \n\n\n\nBikini bottoms underneath \n\nBut the boys' hearts still skip a beat \n\nWhen them girls shimmy off \n\nThem old cutoffs \n\n\n\nAnd it's two bare feet on the dashboard \n\nYoung love and an old Ford \n\nCheap shades and a tattoo \n\n\nAnd a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard \n\n\n\nPerfect song on the radio \n\nSing along 'cause it's one we know \n\nIt's a smile, it's a kiss \n\nIt's a sip of wine, it's summertime \n\nSweet summertime \n\n\n\nThe more things change \n\nThe more they stay the same \n\nDon't matter how old you are \n\nWhen you know what I'm talkin' 'bout \n\nYeah baby when you got \n\n\n\nTwo bare feet on the dashboard \n\nYoung love and an old Ford \n\nCheap shades and a tattoo \n\nAnd a Yoo-Hoo bottle rollin' on the floorboard \n\n\n\n\nPerfect song on the radio \n\nSing along 'cause it's one we know \n\nIt's a smile, it's a kiss \n\nIt's a sip of wine, it's summertime \n\nSweet summertime"}
